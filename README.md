## Add infinite scrolling to collection view.

This is a basic implementation to add infinite scrolling behaviour in a `UICollectionView`.

## Usage
Usage is pretty simple. `InfiniteScrollingBehaviour` has one designated initializer.

```swift
init(withCollectionView collectionView: UICollectionView, andData dataSet: [InfiniteScollingData], delegate: InfiniteScrollingBehaviourDelegate, configuration: CollectionViewConfiguration = .default)
```

`InfiniteScrollingData` is a protocol which your modal needs to conform to. Right now its an empty protocol, but for scalability purpose, I felt like adding data set as collection of custom protocol instead of `Any`.

`CollectionViewConfiguration` can be used to tweak some behaviour of the infinite scrolling.
You neeed to provide `layoutType` and `scrollingDirection`. Based on these two properties, boundary elements are added as well as size for cell is calculated.
By default, `InfiniteScrollingBehaviour` has a `CollectionViewConfiguration` with layout value `.numberOfCellsOnScreen(5)` and `scrollingDirection` is `horizontal`.

## LayoutType
`LayoutType` has two case:
- `case fixedSize(sizeValue: CGFloat, lineSpacing: CGFloat)`: If you need fixed size (if horizontal scrolling, `sizeValue` value will be cell's width, whereas in vertical scrolling, it will be cell's height. )
- `case numberOfCellOnScreen(Double)`: If you dont care about size and you need fixed number of elements on screen irrespective of screen size.



Incase you need to have infinite scrolling with pagination, enable pagination in the collectionView and pass in `numberOfCellsOnScreen` 1.

**Note:** Currently does not support custom flow layout and unequal cell sizes.

## InfiniteScrollingBehaviourDelegate
The delegate has two methods.

```swift
func configuredCell(forItemAtIndexPath indexPath: IndexPath, originalIndex: Int, andData data: InfiniteScollingData, forInfiniteScrollingBehaviour behaviour: InfiniteScrollingBehaviour) -> UICollectionViewCell
func didSelectItem(atIndexPath indexPath: IndexPath, originalIndex: Int, andData data: InfiniteScollingData, inInfiniteScrollingBehaviour behaviour: InfiniteScrollingBehaviour) -> Void
```
First is a required method. Implementation needs to provide a configured `UICollectionViewCell` based on following parameters.
- **indexPath:** Actual indexpath in the collectionView.
- **originalIndex:** Index in the original data set.
- **data**: `InfiniteScollingData` which will be used to configure your cell.


**Note:** If the number of elements in the data set is smaller than the `maxNumberOfCellsOnScreen`, than it automatically adjusts boundary to repeat the same elements on screen.


## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
